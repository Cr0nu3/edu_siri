The size of a. Far as what this way the core code base of. When it when it's first came out ninety ninety one was about thirty thousand one code versus minutes today is he opposed to sixteen million one hundred rolling all the time on. And as I said, you know these your this or do things like know new farmers always coming out. People want new features and are aware of your numerous types. A device drivers that always being added. You're all these thing to add to the property of operating system. So now let's talk about are you would be key features of the operating system actually present on. So he always is essentially responsible for providing a set of standards. Sober, she's actually make up that virtual issue that a fish on and will be. So we're gonna talk about a lot of these different services in this course on but the some some some of the cute soldiers are things like providing a file system from flooding virtual memory on that actually cannibals You know the details your physical memory you that you have to worry about that of your networking, a scheduling you're shooting you time sharing of your. You may not be familiar with all these terms for that final. Basically going to college about everything here on the. Orange is also responsible for coordinating mobile applications of. And multiple users one of those applications and not a couple of objectives. Year on things like and want us to be fair also be have no can you you're running on the share and the machinery how's your to cores we want them to all be able to one their application for not want to be used to one something on the other a huge to just be shut out for the truth so we wanna was to ensure fairness what thought we don't want that from tacoma. The cost of efficiency of your. Would be aware she has reached it was spending all of it's time for to be fair and no one actually get to the watchdog them. That's obviously not not like I'm submitting again. An example of your trade off at you might encounter of you try to optimize for feminists are do trotter for optimize for football. I'm sure that's another question that will serve as for on so your other things the always provides of the open for she about adventure and you know what an awful. For the same time on protecting for memory for one another your to users are running for them to don't want their programs to. These were step on each other on an annual networking and things like security they were all things provided by us so we the goal and in our desire is designing an hour is want the machine to be both convenient to use know for the user, which is essentially engineering problems and how you present your. Your youtube user interface on where you also need the machines the efficient the juice is largely or the system problem how you actually all it's functionality on while still enjoy your fish. Are you actually doing so? Why should we saw the operating systems of well your coffee government estimates providing if structure to users of the infinite memory your infinite to view power resources so force the question is your how can we actually do that a bit more generally of. I said the operating system is a really good example of the. A large scale system and in watch the office new lines reports are we having to make a trade off between things like your performance inconvenience on your performance and simplicity? Officers easy to design a really simple interface for it might not might have performed on well if you do it that way and then alone or questions like to report functionality and hardware software. I'm sort of taught a little bit about that question that classroom toddler architecture arbiters questions about know how much want you know always you for sticking with always itself vs. Putting it in florida on enormously Your friend and former makes life easier for the always designer bags like for the for The harbor desire for your. The breach of understanding is that he always has provided all these services that allow you to actually one application for that and so the. Oh, watching the point where are your hardware and software company that or is essentially what the show on your operating systems are of your. A very important topic, but know there are not a lot of operations are actually development today a republic, one geology, windows Mac, the last one or two to three I'm so you're. You're not probably going to get a job designing.

Bro groups. Computer hardware is constructed toward this goal and application programs are developed to use this hardware. These programs require certain common operation, such as those controller input output devices, the common folk of controlling and allocating resources, or then brought together into one piece of software. You guessed it, the operating system. This explains that comment I made earlier about the programmer be unable to spend time on applications, them sales because he or she is no longer having to write the code to control those devices. We really have no universally accepted definition of what constitutes the operating system. One must say that includes everything a bender ships when you order the operating system. The features included have a very greatly across systems, some systems take up less than a mech about of space and lackey even a full screen editor, whereas others require gigabytes of space and are based entirely on graphical windowing system. For example, your P. C. Windows is a pretty large operating system, whereas Linux generally takes up less space. Of course, As you may know, there are several flavors of Linux, including Mac O. S. And the size of the colonel will vary between the different versions. A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running all the time on the computer. This program is usually called the Colonel. I'm not. Your definition is right word because run all the times really does not define.
