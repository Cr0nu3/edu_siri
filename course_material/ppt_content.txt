Why Study Operating Systems?

» Abstraction: How to get the OS to give users an
illusion of infinite memory, CPUs, resources, world
wide computing, etc.

» System Design: How to make tradeoffs between
performance and the convenience of OS abstractions,
performance and the simplicity of OS design, and
putting functionality in hardware or software.

» Basic Understanding: The OS provides the services

that allow application programs to work at all.

» System Intersection Point: The OS is the point where
hardware and software meet.

System

Not many operating systems are under development, so you are
unlikely to get a job building an OS. However, understanding
operating systems will enable you to use your computer more
effectively. They also serve as an excellent example of system
design issues whose results and ideas you will apply elsewhere.

L   Background: To understand this course you must have a
solid basic understanding of hardware (CPU instruction sets,
memory hierarchies, I/O systems, etc.) and solid programming
skills (complex data structures, classes as an encapsulation
mechanism, etc.)

— Obviously, you cannot understand the implications of how
components intersect without understanding the
